# FontScope - Chrome Web Store Compliance Form

## Single Purpose Description (1000 characters max):
FontScope is a font identification tool that allows users to hover over text on any web page to instantly view font details including family name, size, weight, and color. It provides a clean, professional interface for designers and developers to analyze typography without leaving their workflow.

## Permission Justifications:

### Storage Permission (1000 characters max):
The "storage" permission is used solely to save the user's preference for enabling or disabling the font detection feature. This allows users to turn the extension on/off and have their preference persist across browser sessions and page reloads. No user data, browsing history, or personal information is stored - only a simple boolean flag indicating whether font detection is enabled.

### Tabs Permission (1000 characters max):
The "tabs" permission is used to detect when users switch between browser tabs. This ensures that the font detection toggle state remains synchronized across all tabs. When a user changes the toggle setting in the popup, it automatically applies to all open tabs. Without this permission, the toggle would only work on the currently active tab.

### Host Permission Justification (Updated for Chrome Warning):
FontScope requires broad host permissions ("<all_urls>") because it is a font identification tool that must work on ANY website users visit. Unlike extensions that only work on specific sites, FontScope needs to:

1. Run content scripts on all web pages to detect hover events
2. Read CSS font properties from any website's elements
3. Provide font identification across the entire web

The activeTab permission suggested by Chrome would not work because:
- activeTab only activates when users click the extension icon
- FontScope needs to work passively when hovering over text
- Users expect font identification to work on any page without clicking

This is a legitimate use case for broad permissions. The extension only reads CSS properties locally and displays them in tooltips - no data is transmitted or stored externally. The broad permission is necessary for the core functionality but limited to read-only CSS property access.

## Remote Code Usage:
No, I am not using Remote code.

Justification: All JavaScript and CSS code is included in the extension package. No external scripts, modules, or eval() are used.

## Data Usage Disclosures:

### What user data do you plan to collect from users now or in the future?
FontScope does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data. The extension only reads CSS font properties locally within the browser and displays them in tooltips. No personally identifiable information, browsing history, user activity, or website content is collected or shared.

### Certifications (Check all three):
✅ I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties, outside of the approved use cases
✅ I do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to my item's single purpose
✅ I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
